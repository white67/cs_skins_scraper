### Running Locally (Development)

**1. Database**

You need a running PostgreSQL instance.  
Create the database and table using the provided SQL script:

```bash
# Start your local PostgreSQL server
psql -U <your_user> -d <your_database> -f database/01_create_table.sql
```

**2. Backend**

```bash
cd backend
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

**3. Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**4. Scrapers**

Open a terminal for each scraper you want to run:

```bash
cd scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m main_csfloat
python -m main_skinport
python -m main_dmarket
python -m main_skinbid
```

> **Note:**  
> Make sure your `.env` or `.env.local` files are set up with the correct environment variables for local development.

### Running with Docker Compose

This will start **all services** (database, backend, frontend, scrapers) in containers.

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

- All environment variables are managed via the `.env` file and `docker-compose.yml`.
