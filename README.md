# CS Skins Scraper

**Real-time marketplace scraper to track and find favorite items**

## ðŸ›  How It Works

Project designed to continuously monitoring multiple marketplaces in real time, instantly detecting new listings that match your filters. The system:

1. **Scrapes new listings** from supported marketplaces the moment they appear.
2. **Filters items** based on customizable criteria (e.g., price, condition, stickers, trade status, etc.).
3. **Displays marketplace scraping status**, so you always know if data is up to date.
4. **Provides real-time insights** via the frontend, showing the newest listings as soon as they're available.
